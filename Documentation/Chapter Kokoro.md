# Chapter ?? - Kokoro

## Overview

Kokoro, while not mandatory, offers a wide variety of useful functions. Many mods, including this one, utilize some of its many features to achieve some of its effects.

The API is split across many files, but you only need to pull in the files detailing the APIs you will utilize.

## V1 API

The Kokoro API is currently split between the V1 and V2 API.
The V1 API exists for compatibility purposes, and should not be used in new works. Some of its methods do not function, by design.
